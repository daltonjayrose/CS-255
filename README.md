**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

In this project, I designed a system for the client DriverPass. DriverPass wanted to develop a system to help prepare student drivers for their driving exam by offering study materials, practice tests, and lessons with driving instructors. 

**What did you do particularly well?**

I think I did a good job with understanding the needs of the client and incorporating those needs into the system design.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I think the weakest part of my work in this project was the diagrams. While I think they correctly depicted the system, I think I could do a better job if I were to redesign them because I now better understand how the diagrams work and the overall functionality of the system.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

By utilizing an interview transcript, I was able to determine what the client was looking for. While the client may not always know exactly what they want, it's important to ask good questions to clarify their intent and gain a better understanding of the system you will be designing. For example, the client at one point requested to be able to access information offline which conflicts with the online nature of the system. However, we were able to clarify that the ability to export reports would satisfy the requirement. 

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I begin by trying to understand the use case of the software and the functionality needed by the users. This might be done by conducting interviews or examining the existing workflow. Then, I consider whether that functionality could better be achieved in an alternate way than the one proposed. I also make sure to consider what the best practices are in software development and how the system should be implemented while keeping those in mind.
